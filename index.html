    <h1>My music is simply better. In this essay I will--</h1>
    <p>I don't know my music genre names. I will try to explain the vibes to the best of my ability. Please excuse my poor descriptive skills. Sorry in advance.</p>

    <h2>Classical</h2>
    <p>This one's chill piano for the most part.</p>
    <p>Did you know that Rachmaninoff wanted to be friends with Stravinsky, who had mentioned liking honey, so he showed up to Stravinsky's house in the middle of the night with a jar of honey? Don't ask for sources, I don't know if this is true but I sure hope it is.</p>
